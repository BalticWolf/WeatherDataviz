# WeatherDataviz
This is a project that I did in the frame of the Python Inria online course. The training programme recommended Python 2.7. 

As I aspire to be data scientist, I chose the one project requiring visualization.
The goal was to use the dataviz libraries to represent :
- Histograms (temperatures)
- 2D Plot diagrams (towns localizations)
- 3D surface (air pressure variations) --> not implemented
