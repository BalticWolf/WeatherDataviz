# WeatherDataviz
I worked on this project in the frame of the Python Inria online course (through the F.U.N. platform). The training programme recommended Python 2.7, but I used 3.6 here. 

As I aspire to be data scientist, I chose the one project requiring visualization.
The goal was to use the dataviz libraries to represent :
1: Histograms (temperatures) --> implemented. The overall is fine but the look can be improved
2: 2D Plot diagrams (towns localizations) --> implemented
3: 3D surface (air pressure variations) --> not implemented (yet)

USER GUIDE:
- Open Terminal
- Reach for the work directory
- Type this command for example 1: python ./main.py -n 'Paris' --1d data/cities_idf.json
- or Type this command for example 2: python ./main.py -n 'Paris' --2d data/cities_idf.json
- Press enter and wait for the graph to show up.
